- **Critical Path Coverage**: >85%

### Module Coverage Breakdown
```
Module       | Coverage | Status
-------------|----------|--------
package.ts   | 100%     | ✅ Excellent
pm.ts        | 100%     | ✅ Excellent  
prompts.ts   | 98.46%   | ✅ Excellent
workspace.ts | 86.82%   | ✅ Good
git.ts       | 86.2%    | ✅ Good
index.ts     | 72.88%   | ⚠️ Acceptable (CLI entry)
fsops.ts     | 65.65%   | ⚠️ Acceptable (OS operations)
ui.ts        | 68.75%   | ⚠️ Acceptable (presentation layer)
```

### Test Quality Assessment
- **Integration tests** verify end-to-end workflow
- **Unit tests** cover all critical functions
- **Mock git repositories** test real scenarios
- **Error path testing** validates recovery

## 3. Build & Packaging Status

### ✅ Build System
- TypeScript compilation working correctly
- Source maps generated for debugging
- Shebang preserved in dist/index.js
- ES modules configured properly

### ✅ CLI Execution
```bash
# All working correctly:
dist/index.js --version  # Returns: ccws v1.0.0
dist/index.js --help     # Shows full help text
npm run build           # Compiles successfully
npm test                # All 116 tests pass
```

### ⚠️ Global Installation
- **Status**: Not tested globally via npm link
- **Impact**: Minor - can be installed globally when published
- **Workaround**: Direct execution works perfectly

## 4. Missing Features & Gaps

### Minor Gaps (Non-Critical)

1. **Global npm installation not verified**

2. **Claude CLI not mocked in tests**
   - Integration with real Claude CLI not tested
   - Fallback mechanism is tested

3. **Cross-filesystem operations**
   - Hardlink failures only tested via mock

   - Partial failure recovery
   - Graceful degradation
   - Comprehensive error handling

## 5. Code Quality Assessment

- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with proper typing
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns across 9 modules
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with informative messages
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization throughout

### Areas for Improvement
- Some UI helper functions could have better test coverage
- Claude CLI integration could use integration tests
- Some complex functions could be further decomposed

## 6. Functionality Verification

### What Works ✅
1. **Repository Discovery**: Finds all git repos within 3 levels
2. **Interactive Selection**: User-friendly prompts with customization
3. **Worktree Creation**: Creates isolated worktrees correctly
4. **Dependency Priming**: Hardlinks node_modules efficiently
5. **Environment Copying**: Preserves .env files
6. **Package Manager Detection**: Identifies npm/yarn/pnpm
7. **Claude.md Generation**: Creates documentation via CLI or fallback
8. **Root Package.json**: Generates orchestration scripts
9. **Error Recovery**: Handles failures gracefully
10. **Progress Feedback**: Shows clear status throughout

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- No significant broken functionality identified

### What's Missing 🔍
- No critical missing features
- All specifications are implemented

## 7. Recommendation

**The cc-workspace-manager is READY FOR PRODUCTION USE.**

The implementation:
- ✅ Meets all specification requirements
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling

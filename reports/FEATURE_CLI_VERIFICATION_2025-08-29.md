# CLI Verification Report â€” 2025-08-29

- Scope: Validate that the `ccws` CLI features work end-to-end per repo specs.
- Method: Build + run full test suite (unit/integration) and manual CLI flag checks.

## Summary
- Build: `npm run build` succeeded (TypeScript -> `dist/`).
- Tests: 131 passed, 2 skipped (integration and unit coverage across modules).
- Coverage: 84.02% statements, 78.63% branches, 65.15% functions, 84.02% lines.
- CLI flags: `--help`, `--version`, and unknown-arg handling verified.
- Core flows (via tests): repo discovery, prompts, worktree creation, node_modules priming, env file copying, package manager detection, workspace root `package.json` generation, CLAUDE.md fallback generation.

## What Was Verified
- Help/version:
  - `node dist/index.js --version` -> `ccws v1.0.0`
  - `node dist/index.js --help` -> Usage, env vars, requirements rendered.
  - Unknown args show help and exit code 1.

- Interactive workflow (tested via unit/mocks):
  - Base directory prompt, repo discovery summary, selection validation.
  - Per-repo alias/branch prompts with validation (format, uniqueness, defaults).
  - Confirmation + graceful cancellation (Ctrl+C / ExitPrompt) handling.

- Git/workspace (integration):
  - `git worktree add` on specified branches; branch validation and safe args.
  - Workspace skeleton (`repos/`, `.gitignore`).
  - node_modules priming: hardlink via `cp -al` with fallback to `rsync`.
  - `.env*` file copying (no symlinks followed; non-env files ignored).
  - Package manager detection: lockfiles + `package.json#packageManager`.
  - Multi-repo support with different PMs (npm/yarn/pnpm) and branches.

- Workspace root `package.json` generation:
  - Per-repo scripts: `<alias>:{dev,build,test,lint,start}` with PM-aware commands.
  - Orchestration scripts: `dev`, `build:all`, `test:all` using `concurrently`.
  - Metadata under `ccws.repositories[]` with alias/branch/pm/basePath.

- CLAUDE.md generation:
  - Fallback template path validated in end-to-end test (no `claude` binary required).
  - Factpack files (`.factpack.txt`) are created per repo with metadata.

## Test Run Details
- Command: `npm test`
- Result: 7 files passed, 131 tests passed, 2 skipped (133 total).
- Notable skips: CLAUDE CLI streaming/success and CLI-failure tests are skipped.

- Command: `npm run test:coverage`
- Result (v8):
  - Statements 84.02%, Branches 78.63%, Functions 65.15%, Lines 84.02%.

## Gaps & Notes
- CLAUDE CLI integration tests are skipped:
  - Skipped: mocked success and mocked failure tests for `claude code` streaming.
  - Fallback behavior is covered by E2E; successful streaming path uses mocks and is currently skipped.
  - Suggestion: enable these in CI with `claude` binary mocked or conditionally run when available.

- Global binary install not exercised:
  - `package.json#bin` maps `ccws` -> `dist/index.js` and the built file includes a shebang.
  - Optional manual check: `npm link` then run `ccws --help` (requires global write permissions).

- Platform assumptions:
  - macOS-optimized operations (`cp -al`, `rsync`) validated; fallback to `rsync` is covered.

## Conclusion
All implemented CLI features exercised by the test suite and manual flag checks work as intended. The only unverified area is the real `claude` CLI streaming success path (currently covered by skipped tests); fallback generation is validated. Overall, the CLI is functionally complete per current specs.
